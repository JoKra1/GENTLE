## Introduction:

GENTLE - The Grapical Ego-Network Tool for Longitudinal Examination, is a frontend framework including multiple modular components designed to allow researchers to easily gather data about social & ego networks. Gentle runs on React and relies on the D3.js library for the data-driven visualisation of individuals involved in a social network. Those individuals are represented as nodes and GENTLE offers various ways to manipulate, interact with, and change the nodes and relationships between them in an easy, playful way.

## GENTLE's purpose:
GENTLE was designed to work well on mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Thus, if you want to collect ego-network data on mobile phones, GENTLE might be the right choice for you. This is especially the case if you want your participants to be able to start on mobile and then switch to PC at a later point: GENTLE has all the front-end functionality implemented to support this.

## Alternatives:
If GENTLE does not offer directly what you need, you can always build your own components. The modular design of GENTLE should help with this. You also might want to check out [GENSI](http://www.tobiasstark.nl/GENSI/GENSI.htm) which inspired the work on GENTLE and includes screen layouts that fully utilize all the space available on larger screens (i.e. on laptops or desktop PCs). If you do not want to program your own study, check out [Network Canvas](https://www.networkcanvas.com/) which offers a complete network data collection suite.
